# Holey_Streets_Pothole_Tracker
This pothole tracker web application allows users to crowd-source data to report potholes in their city on a map and include a link to a picture of the pothole as well as file a damage claim. Administrators can give users "Employee" access to the site and approve/deny damage claims, and Employees can rank pothole severity, mark potholes as "inspected" and "repaired", and delete duplicate pothole reports.

The app was developed using Vue.js on the front-end, and an ASP.NET Web-API and MS SQL database on the back-end.

This app was created as a final capstone project with a team of 3 other people as a part of the Tech Elevator .NET Coding Bootcamp.
